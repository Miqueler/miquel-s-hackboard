This is my 4 key macropad with 2 SK6812MINI Leds, and uses KMK firmware


## Features:
- 2 SK6812MINI  LEDs. 
- 4 Keys

## CAD Model:
It has 2 separate printed pieces. The base where the PCB sits, and the top cover.

## Firmware Overview
This hackpad uses [KMK]([https://kmk.fm/](https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware)) firmware for everything. 

- The 4 keys currently act as macros.


I might add more in the future! That's it for now but this has been a cool learning experience, a way to start to dabble into this world of design, both for the PBC design part of things as well as the 3d modeling!

## BOM:
Here should be everything you need to make this hackpad

- 4x Cherry MX Switches
- 4x DSA Keycaps
- 2x SK6812MINI LEDs
- 1x 0.91" 128x32 OLED Display
- 1x XIAO RP2040
- 1x Case (2 printed parts)
